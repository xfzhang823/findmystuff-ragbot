\r\n \r\nDivisions of Administrative Areas  refer to the division \r\nof administrative areas by the State. The relative laws define \r\nthe administrative division as follows: 1) the whole country is \r\ndivided into provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities \r\ndirectly under the Central Government; 2) provinces and \r\nautonomous regions are further divided into autonomous \r\nprefectures, counties, autonomous counties and cities; 3) \r\nautonomous prefectures are further divided into counties, \r\nautonomous counties and cities; 4) counties and autonomous \r\ncounties are further divided into townships, ethnic townships \r\nand towns; 5) municipalities directly under the Central \r\nGovernment and large cities are divided into districts and \r\ncounties, 6) the State shall, when necessary, establish special \r\nadministrative regions. \r\nAverage Annual Growth Rate  shows the average \r\ngrowth rate of social and economic development during a \r\nlonger period. It can not be directly calculated by chain based \r\ngrowth rate. The relation is: \r\nAverage growth rate = average speed of development \u2013 1 \r\nAverage speed of development is the time series average \r\nof speed which is obtained through chain-based calculation. \r\nBecause the reference bases during the different periods are \r\ndifferent, average speed of development can not be calculated \r\nby the general method. Level approach and accumulative \r\napproach for calculating average speed of development rate are \r\napplied. The \u201clevel approach\u201d, or geometric average approach, \r\nis derived by the formula of geometric average of the \r\nchain-based \r\nspeeds \r\nof \r\ndevelopment \r\nby \r\ncontinuous \r\nmultiplication. The other is called the \u201caccumulative approach\u201d \r\nor the \u201cequation\u201d method, which is derived by the summation \r\nof the actual figure of each year in the interval divided by the \r\nfigure in the base year. The level approach focuses on the level \r\nof the last year, while the accumulative approach emphasizes \r\nthe aggregate development for the entire duration.  \r\nThe average annual growth rates listed in the Yearbook are \r\ncalculated by the level approach except for the growth rate of \r\ninvestment in fixed assets. The base year is not listed in the \r\nduration for which average annual growth rates are computed. \r\nFor instance, the average annual growth rate of the 43 years \r\nsince 1949 is shown as the average annual growth rate of \r\n1950-1992 without showing the base year 1949.  \r\nIndustrial Classification of the National Economy  \r\nThe new Industrial Classification of the National Economy \r\n(GB/T 4754-2017) is introduced starting from the compilation \r\nof 2017 annual statistics and 2018 monthly or quarterly \r\nstatistics. The revision, based on the 2011 classification, was \r\norganized by the National Bureau of Statistics taking into \r\nconsideration of the characteristics of economic activities in \r\nChina and the International Standards of the Industrial \r\nClassification of All Economic Activities (ISIC/Rev.4) of the \r\nUnited Nations. The new Classification was promulgated by \r\nthe former National Administration of Quality Supervision, \r\nInspection \r\nand \r\nQuarantine \r\nand \r\nthe \r\nStandardization \r\nAdministration of the People's Republic of China on June 30, \r\n2017.

Gross domestic product is expressed in \r\nthree different perspectives, namely value, income, and \r\nproducts respectively. GDP in its value perspective refers to the \r\nbalance of total value of all goods and services produced by all \r\nresident units during a certain period of time, minus the total \r\nvalue of input of goods and services of the nature of non-fixed \r\nassets; in other words, it is the sum of the value-added of all \r\nresident units. GDP from the perspective of income refers to \r\nthe sum of all kinds of revenue, including compensation of \r\nemployees, net taxes on production, depreciation of fixed assets, \r\nand operating surplus. GDP from the perspective of products \r\nrefers to the value of all goods and services for final demand by \r\nall resident units plus the net exports of goods and services \r\nduring a given period of time. In the practice of national \r\naccounting, gross domestic product is calculated by three \r\napproaches, namely production approach, income approach and \r\nexpenditure approach, which reflect gross domestic product \r\nand its composition from different angles. \r\nFor a region, it is called as gross regional product(GRP) or \r\nregional GDP. \r\nGross National Income (GNI)  originally known as \r\ngross national product(GNP), refers to the final result of the \r\nprimary distribution of the income created by all resident units \r\nof a country during a certain period of time. The value-added \r\ncreated by the resident units of a country engaged in production \r\nactivities is distributed, during the primary distribution, mainly \r\nto the resident units of that country, while part of it is \r\ndistributed to the non-resident units in the form of production \r\ntax (minus subsidies to production), compensation of \r\nemployees and property income. In the meantime, a part of the \r\nvalue-added created abroad is distributed to the resident units \r\nof the country in the form of production tax (minus subsidies to \r\nproduction), compensation of employees and property income. \r\nThe concept of gross national income is thus developed, which \r\nequals to gross domestic product plus the net income from \r\nprimary distribution from abroad. Unlike GDP which is a \r\nconcept of production, GNI is a concept of income. \r\nThree Strata of Industry  Classification of economic \r\nactivities into three strata of industries is a common practice in \r\nthe world, although the grouping varies to some extent from \r\ncountry to country.

It \r\nreflects the total scale and results of agricultural production \r\nduring a given period. Before 1993, the gross output value of \r\nagriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery included \r\nagriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline and fishery. \r\nSince 1993, the subdivision of sideline occupations has been \r\ncancelled, and the hunting of wild animals has been classified \r\ninto animal husbandry, and the gathering of wild plants and \r\ncommodity industry run by rural household have been included \r\nin farming. A new industrial classification of economic \r\nactivities was introduced in 2003. Under the new classification, \r\nthe gross output value of agriculture included the value of \r\nfarming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, and included \r\nvalue of services to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and \r\nfishery. In 2018, the output value of services to agriculture, \r\nforestry, animal husbandry and fishery was renamed the output \r\nvalue of professional and support activities in agriculture, \r\nforestry, animal husbandry and fishery, value of industrial \r\noutput by rural households is not included in agriculture. \r\nAccording to the result of the first, second and third agriculture \r\ncensus, efforts were made to adjust the output value of \r\nagriculture, animal husbandry and fishery output. In line with \r\nthe Classification of Products for Statistical Purposes \r\nimplemented in 2010, relevant revisions were made on the \r\noutput value of agriculture and forestry in 2009.  \r\nGross output value of agriculture is calculated by product \r\nmethod, and is obtained by multiplying the output of each \r\nproduct or by-product by its price, resulting in the output value \r\nof each single item. For a small number of products, annual \r\noutput of which is not available or difficult to get due to the \r\nlong production (growing) process involved, the output value is \r\nestimated through an indirect approach. The sum of output \r\nvalues of all products of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry \r\nand fishery and professional and support activities in \r\nagriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery is then \r\nequal to the gross output value of agriculture. \r\nGrain Output  refers to the total output of grains \r\nproduced within a calendar year. It includes summer crops, \r\nearly rice and autumn crops by harvest seasons; and covers \r\ncereals, beans and tubers by type of crops. Output of cereals \r\ncover husked grain only. Output of beans refers to dry beans \r\nwithout pods. The output of tubers (sweet potatoes and potatoes, \r\nnot including taros and cassava) are converted with the ratio of \r\n4:1, i.e. 4 kilograms of fresh tubers were equivalent to 1 \r\nkilogram of grain before 1964. Since 1964 the ratio has been \r\nchanged to 5:1. Tubers consumed as vegetables (such as \r\npotatoes) in cities and suburbs are calculated as fresh \r\nvegetables and their output is not included in the output of \r\ngrain. Data on grain production before 1989 were obtained \r\nthrough the comprehensive statistical reporting system. Since \r\n1989, data from sample surveys are used. \r\nCotton Output  refers to cotton production in the whole \r\ncountry including cotton planted in spring and in summer. \r\nOutput is measured as the weight of ginned cotton.

It covers public roads \r\nrunning vehicles between cities, between urban and rural areas, \r\nand between townships (villages), as well as highways passing \r\nthrough streets at small cities and towns, length of bridges and \r\ntunnels, width of ferry piers. It does not include the length of \r\nstreets in cities, dead end highways, the length of streets built \r\nfor agricultural (forest) production and inside factories (mines). \r\nMileage can only be included when the road is completed, \r\nchecked and accepted or put into operation. If two or more \r\nhighways use the same section, the length of the section is \r\ncounted only once. \r\nLength of Navigable Inland Waterways  refers to the \r\nlength of natural rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals that are \r\nopen to navigation for ships and rafts during a given period. It \r\nincludes the channels with annual seasonal navigation for more \r\nthan three months, excluding waterways for scattered bamboo \r\nand wooden rafts. If two provinces share one river as the border, \r\nthe length of waterways will be equally divided for each \r\nprovince to avoid duplication. \r\nLength of Regular Civil Aviation Routes refers to the \r\ntotal length of all routes for scheduled flights, which is \r\ncalculated using 10,000 kilometres as the measuring unit. There \r\nare usually two ways to calculate the route length: duplicated \r\ncalculation \r\nand \r\nnon-duplicated \r\ncalculation. \r\nDuplicated \r\ncalculation means that the same segment of different routes can \r\nbe added with duplication, while the non-duplicated calculation \r\nallows the same segment of different routes to be counted only \r\nonce.  \r\nLength of Oil (Gas) Pipelines  refers to the actual \r\ntransport distance of oil, gas and oil products, an indicator to \r\nreflect the length of pipeline routes and a reference to calculate \r\nthe freight-kilometers. For those sections with double pipelines \r\nand alternate pipelines, the length will be calculated according \r\nto the length of single pipeline in principle. If the double \r\npipelines perform the transportation at the same time and is \r\nunable to be counted separately, the length of pipelines will be \r\nthe length of double pipelines divided by 2.  \r\nFreight (Passenger) Traffic  refers to the weight of \r\nfreight (number of passengers) transported with various means \r\nwithin a specific period of time. Freight transport is calculated \r\nin tons and passenger traffic is calculated in terms of number of \r\npersons. Freight transport is calculated in terms of the actual \r\nweight of the goods, irrespective of the type of freight and \r\ndistance of transport. Passenger traffic is calculated by the \r\nprinciple that one person can be counted only once in one trip, \r\nirrespective of travelling distance and ticket price. The \r\npassengers who travel with a discounted ticket or a children \r\nticket is also calculated as one person.  \r\nFreight Ton-kilometres (Passenger-kilometres) refers to \r\nthe sum of the product of the volume of transported cargo \r\n(passengers) multiplied by the transport distance.

GNI is computed as follows: \r\nGNI = GDP + Net external primary income flows \r\n= GDP + Primary income earned by residents  \r\nfrom outside the economic territory -  \r\nPrimary income earned by non-residents  \r\nfrom within the economic territory \r\nPrimary income  comprises investment income and \r\ncompensation of employees (CE).  Investment income \r\nincludes direct investment income (DII), portfolio investment \r\nincome (PII) and other investment income (OII) as well as \r\nincome on reserve assets (RA). \r\nPer capita GNI  of an economy is obtained by dividing \r\nGNI in a year by the mid-year population of that economy in \r\nthe same year. \r\nBalance of Payments (BoP)  is a statistical statement \r\n \r\n \r\n876 \r\nMain Social and Economic Indicators of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \r\nthat systematically summarises, for a specific time period \r\n(typically a year or a quarter), the economic transactions of an \r\neconomy with the rest of the world (i.e. between residents and \r\nnon-residents).  A BoP account comprises two broad accounts : \r\n(a) the current account; and (b) the capital and financial \r\naccount. \r\nCurrent Account  measures the flows of goods, services, \r\nprimary income and secondary income between residents and \r\nnon-residents. \r\nGoods  under the BoP current account mainly cover \r\ngeneral merchandise, net exports of goods under merchanting \r\nand non-monetary gold.  \r\nServices  under the BoP current account mainly cover \r\nmanufacturing services, transport, travel, insurance and pension \r\nservices, financial services and other services.   \r\nPrimary Income Account  shows the amounts \r\nreceivable and payable abroad in return for providing/obtaining \r\nuse of labour, financial resources or natural resources to/from \r\nnon-residents.  The concepts and definitions of primary \r\nincome under the current account of the BoP are the same as \r\nthose of the external primary income flows under GNI. \r\nSecondary Income Account  records current transfers \r\nbetween residents and non-residents.  Current transfers are \r\ntransactions in which real or financial resources that are likely \r\nto be consumed immediately or shortly are provided without \r\nthe receipt of equivalent economic values in return.  Current \r\ntransfers are unilateral in nature and are offsetting entries in the \r\nBoP account for one-sided transactions. Examples include \r\nworkers' remittances, donations, official assistance and \r\npensions. \r\nCapital Account  measures external transactions in \r\ncapital transfers, and the acquisition and disposal of \r\nnon-produced, non-financial assets (such as trademarks and \r\nbrand names).  Examples of capital transfers include \r\nforgiveness of debts by creditors, and cash transfers involving \r\nthe acquisition or disposal of fixed assets. \r\nFinancial Account  records transactions in financial \r\nassets and liabilities between residents and non-residents.", "start_char_idx": 3450, "end_char_idx": 8396, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9cdd153-3c14-4c22-a7e8-38efcb5f499e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9cdd153-3c14-4c22-a7e8-38efcb5f499e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\github\\xf_knowledge_RAG\\data\\yearbook text data\\zbe26.txt", "file_name": "zbe26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25367, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "C:\\github\\xf_knowledge_RAG\\data\\yearbook text data\\zbe26.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\github\\xf_knowledge_RAG\\data\\yearbook text data\\zbe26.txt", "file_name": "zbe26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25367, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "807bf33c9d4fd4c78e44245f262837f4ce2ce02b87f8bdda19c9602f83dfe338", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0616ac6e-1d35-41a5-bb1e-1285cf7f4c41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\github\\xf_knowledge_RAG\\data\\yearbook text data\\zbe26.txt", "file_name": "zbe26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25367, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "27356bb695ce3b7a2314acc6289ac77b90fb59258af12e37dcc8e6ccef995e1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0ea80c2-4508-484b-85e5-33a113b6277c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac046355db66aefcac5a385b6830ddb5dc2651454314d6be054e9b962f4d4ceb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Secondary Income Account  records current transfers \r\nbetween residents and non-residents.

For \r\nstatistical purpose, an effective voice is taken as being \r\nequivalent to a holding of 10% or more of the voting power in \r\nan enterprise. \r\nPortfolio \r\nInvestment \r\n \r\nrefers \r\nto \r\ninvestment \r\nin \r\nnon-resident equity securities and debt securities (e.g. bonds \r\nand notes, money market instruments), other than that included \r\nin direct investment or reserve assets.  Compared with direct \r\ninvestors, portfolio investors have no lasting interest or \r\ninfluence in the management of the enterprises concerned.  A \r\nholding of less than 10% of the voting power in an enterprise is \r\nregarded as portfolio investment. \r\nFinancial Derivatives  are financial instruments that are \r\nlinked to another specific financial instrument, indicator or \r\ncommodity, and through which specific financial risks (such as \r\ninterest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity and commodity \r\nprice risks, credit risk, and so on) can be traded in their own \r\nright in financial markets.  Financial derivatives include \r\noption-type contracts (e.g. warrants and options) and \r\nforward-type contracts (e.g. futures, interest rate swaps, \r\ncurrency swaps, forward rate agreements, forward foreign \r\nexchange contracts). \r\nOther Investment  refers to other financial claims on \r\nand liabilities to non-residents that are not classified as direct \r\ninvestment, portfolio investment, financial derivatives or \r\nreserve assets.  Other investment includes non-marketable \r\nloans, currency and deposits, trade credits and advances, and \r\nother assets/liabilities.  \r\nReserve Assets  are external assets that are readily \r\navailable to and controlled by the monetary authority of an \r\neconomy (which refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority \r\nin the case of Hong Kong) for meeting balance of payments \r\nfinancing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to \r\nregulate the currency exchange rate of that economy, and for \r\nother related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the \r\ncurrency and the economy, and serving as a basis for foreign \r\nborrowing). \r\nInternational Investment Position (IIP)  is a balance \r\nsheet showing the stock of external financial assets and \r\nliabilities of an economy at a particular time point. The \r\ndifference between the external financial assets and liabilities is \r\nthe net IIP of the economy, which represents either its net claim \r\non or net liability to the rest of the world.  Being fully \r\nconsistent with the BoP financial account, IIP is also \r\ncategorised by type of investment.  Assets and liabilities are \r\ndivided into direct investment, portfolio investment, financial \r\nderivatives and other investment.  The asset side of IIP also \r\nincludes the reserve assets.

Typical examples of inward direct investment are \r\nmultinational corporations\u2019 branches and subsidiaries operating \r\nin Hong Kong. \r\nOutward Direct Investment  refers to direct investment \r\nby a Hong Kong resident on a non-resident enterprise. \r\nPosition of Direct Investment  refers to the value of \r\ninvestment abroad or investment received from abroad of Hong \r\nKong residents at a specified date. \r\nFlow of Direct Investment refers to the additions/ \r\nwithdrawals of investment abroad or investment received from \r\nabroad of Hong Kong residents during a period. \r\nLoan Fund  finances loans and advances for such \r\nschemes as housing loans and education loans.  The main \r\nsources of income are appropriations from the General \r\nRevenue Account, loan repayments and interest on loans. \r\nEffective Exchange Rate Index (EERI) for the Hong \r\nKong Dollar (HKD) is an index which measures movements \r\nin the weighted average of the exchange rate of the HKD \r\nagainst the currencies of major trading partners of Hong Kong.  \r\nIt serves as an indicator for measuring the overall strength of \r\nthe HKD relative to selected currencies.
