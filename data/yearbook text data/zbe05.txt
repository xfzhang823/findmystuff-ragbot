Producer Prices Indices for Farm Products  are relative 
figures reflecting the trend and degree of changes in producersâ€™ 
prices received by farmers when they sell farm products during 
a given period. These indices depict the change in the level and

accounts statistics. The producer price index for a given 
product is calculated as the geometrical mean of individual 
indices for all surveyed units which sell such products, and the
