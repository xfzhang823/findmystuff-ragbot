Explanatory Notes on Main Statistical Indicators 
 
 
Total Primary Energy Production  refers to the total 
production of primary energy in a given period of time. It is a 
comprehensive indicator to show the level, scale, composition 
and growth of energy production of the country. It includes that 
of coal, crude oil, natural gas, hydropower and electricity 
generated by nuclear energy and other means such as wind 
power and geothermal power, etc. However, it does not include 
the production of fuels of low calorific value and secondary 
energy converted from primary energy. 
Total Energy Consumption  refers to the total 
consumption of energy of various kinds by the production 
sectors of the economy and the households in a given period of 
time. It includes primary energy such as coal, crude oil, natural 
gas, hydropower, nuclear power, wind power, solar power, 
geothermal power and bio-energy; the secondary energy and 
their products which are transformed from the primary energy 
such as washed coal, coke, coal gas, electricity, heating, and 
petroleum products; and other kinds of fossil energy, renewable 
energy and new energy. The renewable energy refers to the part 
of renewable energy that is attained with some given technical 
means 
and 
used 
for 
commercial 
purposes, including 
hydropower, wind power, solar power, geothermal power and 
bio-energy. In the process of accounting, there should be no 
double or multiple counting between and primary and the 
secondary accounting. Total energy consumption can be 
divided into three parts: final energy consumption; loss during 
the process of energy transformation; and other losses. 
(1) Final Energy Consumption: It refers to the 
consumption of various kinds of energy in a given period of 
time, not involving the energy consumed for transformation. 
(2) Losses During the Process of Energy Transformation: 
It refers to the total input of various kinds of energy for 
transformation, minus the total output of various kinds of 
energy products in a given period of time. It is an indicator to 
show the losses that occurs during the process of energy 
transformation. 
(3) Other Losses: It refers to the total of the losses of 
energy during the course of energy transport, distribution and 
storage and the losses caused by any objective reason in a given 
period of time. The losses of various kinds of gas due to gas 
discharges and stocktaking is not included. 
Elasticity Ratio of Energy Production  is an indicator 
to show the relationship between the growth rate of energy 
production and the growth rate of the national economy. The 
formula is:

The average annual growth rate of the national economy 
can be measured by indicators such as the gross national 
product or the gross domestic product, depending on the  
purposes or needs. The gross domestic product has been used in 
the calculation of the ratio in the Yearbook. 
Elasticity Ratio of Electricity Production  is an 
indicator to show the relationship between the growth rate of 
electricity production and the growth rate of the national 
economy. The formula is:

consumption and the growth rate of the national economy. The

Efficiency of Energy Transformation  refers to the 
ratio of the total output of various kinds of energy products 
after transformation to the total input of various kinds of energy  
for transformation during a given period. It is an important 
indicator

current
