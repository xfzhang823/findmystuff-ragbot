Explanatory Notes on Main Statistical Indicators 
 
 
 
Total Population  refers to the total number of people 
alive at a certain point of time within a given area. 
The annual statistics on total population is taken at 
midnight, the 3lst of December, not including residents in Hong 
Kong SAR, Macao SAR and Taiwan and Chinese national 
residing abroad. 
Urban Population and Rural Population  Urban 
population refers to all people residing in cities and towns, 
while rural population refers to population other than urban 
population. 
Birth Rate (or Crude Birth Rate)  refers to the ratio of 
the number of births to the average population (or mid-year 
population) during a certain period of time (usually a year), 
expressed in ‰. Birth rate in the chapter refers to annual birth 
rate. The following formula is used: 
population

Annual


×1000‰ 
Number of births in the formula refers to live births, i.e. 
when a baby has breathed or showed any vital phenomena 
regardless of the length of pregnancy. 
Annual average population is the average of the number of 
population at the beginning of the year and that at the end of 
the year. Sometimes it is substituted by the mid-year 
population. 
Death Rate (or Crude Death Rate) refers to the ratio of 
the number of deaths to the average population (or mid-year 
population) during a certain period of time (usually a year), 
expressed in ‰. Death rate in the chapter refers to annual 
death rate. The following formula is used:

Natural Growth Rate of Population  refers to the ratio 
of natural increase in population (number of births minus 
number of deaths) in a certain period of time (usually a year) to 
the average population (or mid-year population) of the same 
period, expressed in ‰. The following formula is applied:

Gross Dependency Ratio also called gross dependency 
coefficient, refers to the ratio of non-working-age population to 
the working-age population, express in %. Describing in 
general the number of non-working-age population that every 
100 people at working ages will take care of. The gross 
dependency ratio is calculated with the following formula:

GDR
 
Where: GDR is the gross dependency ratio, 
P0-14  is the population of children aged 0-14, 
P65+  is the elderly population aged 65 and over, and 
P15-64 is the working-age population aged 15-64. 
Elderly Dependency Ratio  also called elderly 
dependency coefficient, refers to the ratio of the elderly 
population to the working-age population, express in %. It 
describes the number of the elderly population that every 100 
people at working ages will take care of. Elderly dependency 
ratio is one of the indicators reflecting the social implication of 
population aging from the economic perspective. The elderly 
dependency ratio is calculated with the following formula:

P15-64 is the working-age population aged 15-64. 
Children Dependency Ratio also called children 
dependency coefficient, refers to the ratio of the children 
population to the working-age population, express in %. It 
describes the number of children population that every 100 
people at working ages will take care of. The children 
dependency ratio is calculated with the following formula:

CDR
 
Where: CDR is the children dependency ratio,

P15-64 is the working-age population aged 15-64. 
Population of Residence-registration Inconsistency  
refer to those who have been residing in places other than the 
registered streets or towns and been away from their 
registration areas for over half a year. 
Migrant 
Population 
refer 
to 
the 
population 
of 
residence-registration inconsistency excluding those intra-city 
ones. 
Population 
of 
intra-city 
residence-registration 
inconsistency refer to those whose residing streets or towns and 
registered ones are inconsistent but still in the same 
municipality or prefecture city either the two are in the same 
district or different ones.
